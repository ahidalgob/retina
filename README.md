# Retina Interpreter

## Retina
[Logo] inspired language, based on image generation. Each program has a 'pen' and commands to draw with it.

## Interpreter
Made with Haskell for a project [Translators and Interpreters] course at Universidad Simon Bolivar.

Examples:
```
program
    for k from 1 to 10 do
        for i from 1 to 50 do
            forward(1);
            rotatel(1);
        end;
        for i from 1 to 90 do
            forward(1);
            rotater(1);
        end;
    end;
end;
```
